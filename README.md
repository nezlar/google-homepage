My first project for HTML/CSS on The Odin Project. I am to deconstruct and rebuild google.com using dev tools and what I've learned so far. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. It will not have a fully functional form, but should look the part of google.com.
